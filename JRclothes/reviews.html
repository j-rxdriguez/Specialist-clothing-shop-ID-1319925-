		<q>I wear these with trainer type shoes and they are very comfortable, however I imagine they would be just as comfortable in safety boots. They are a fairly thick fabric and feel a little padded at the toe and heel so should be fine, they are not a long sock and come halfway up the calf.

		<q>Wow super comfy and the padded sole is brilliant.
		Bought them for my hubby because he had recently had sweaty feet which indicates your socks are not breathable and also not healthy for your feet
		I found these socks and read the reviews which were pretty good so I thought, okay looks good so I will give them a try.
		He has not had 1 episode of sweaty feet since wearing these which believe me makes all of us very happy including my hubby lol.
		So from now on these are the socks for all of us.
		Thanks for taking the time to read this and trust me you won't regret it.
